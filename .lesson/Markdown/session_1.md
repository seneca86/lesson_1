# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

## Why learn Python?

### Introduction to the class
During Programming 0 and I we have learnt R, which is a programming language with a focus on statistics and data science.

In Programming II we will use Python, which has a broader scope (although it is excellent too for data science). Before jumping into the specifics, let's remember what a programming language consists of.

### Elements of a programming language
A programming language is not that different from other patterns or languages that we encounter in daily life, be it a cooking recipe, a knitting pattern, a board game, a videogame, or a foreign language. Most of them consist of:
- a regular _vocabulary_
- _syntax_ rules
- sequences of _operations_
- repetitions of some operations (_loops_)
- reference to other operations (_functions_)
- assumptions about the _context_
- _data_ to be used, created or modified
- _tools_ to work with the data
- an expected _result_

### Introducing Python
Let's see our first Python program to get a glimpse of its look and feel:
```Python
for day in ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']:
    print('')
```
